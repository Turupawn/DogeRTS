  # Example of regular route:

  # Example resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
  #   resources :products

  # Example resource route with options:
  #   resources :products do

  #       post 'toggle'

  # Example resource route with sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments, :sales
  #     resource :seller

  # Example resource route with more complex sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do

  # Example resource route within a namespace:
  #   namespace :admin do

  #     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
  #     resources :products
